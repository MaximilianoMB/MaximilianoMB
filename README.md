Hi there!👋

🍀 About Me 

I´m Max, a lifelong learner, currently in a deep dive in Web Development using JS, Node.js and React! 
Here I share my projects, ongoing or finished, using the power of Javascript aswell as exploring other people´s work!

🌱 I have a strong desire to use techlonogy to improve my life and the life of people around me, learning what is possible (what isn´t?) broadens life itself and I try to express that through my work.

🤔 Looking to contribute and help other people in different and interesting projects anyway I can.

💬 You can reach me in:

⚡ Fun fact: I´ve spent years living out of a backpack travelling around the world. Now I´ve found my home! 😄
